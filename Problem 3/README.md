# Code analysis

This questions solution Assyntotical speed time is O(n), n being the length of the smallest string, as the solution only goes through one loop that on the worst case goes from 0 to smallest.length - 1. 

Space complexity is O(1), in place, since I didn't create any auxiliary inputsize-dependant objects.
